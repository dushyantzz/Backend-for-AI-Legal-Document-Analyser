Under the provisions of the Digital India Act, 2023, and in accordance with the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan guidelines, all rural service providers implementing technology-based solutions for village administration must ensure compliance with data protection regulations as stipulated under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023. Service providers are mandated to maintain transparent data handling practices, provide multilingual accessibility features in accordance with the Official Languages Act, 1963, and ensure that digital services remain accessible to citizens with limited digital literacy. Furthermore, any platform facilitating government document processing, land record management, or panchayat-level administrative functions must be registered with the appropriate District Collector's office and maintain audit trails as per the Right to Information Act, 2005. Non-compliance with these provisions may result in penalties ranging from ₹10,000 to ₹5,00,000, suspension of service authorization, and potential criminal liability under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. All rural technology service providers must also ensure adherence to the Goods and Services Tax regulations for digital services as outlined in the GST Act, 2017, particularly for cross-district service delivery mechanisms."
